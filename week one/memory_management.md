### **9. Review and Build**
   - **Review:**
     - Revisit key concepts and FAQs.
   - **Build:**
     - Create a JavaScript project that requires careful memory management.
     - Profile and optimize the memory usage of the project.

---


### **Step 1: Basics of Memory Management**

Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating how memory is allocated, used, and freed in a program. In JavaScript, memory management happens automatically through **garbage collection**, but understanding the underlying concepts helps you write more efficient code.

#### **Key Concepts:**

1. **What is Memory?**
   - **Memory** is where data is stored temporarily while a program runs.
   - It is broadly divided into:
     - **Stack:** Fast memory for storing function calls, primitive values, and control flow.
     - **Heap:** Larger, slower memory for storing objects and reference data.

2. **How JavaScript Manages Memory:**
   - JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects or variables are created.
   - When objects or variables are no longer needed, JavaScript frees the memory through **garbage collection**.

3. **Why Learn Memory Management?**
   - To avoid **memory leaks** (when unused memory isn't released).
   - To optimize your codeâ€™s performance.

#### **Stack vs. Heap**

| **Feature**      | **Stack**                        | **Heap**                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**       | Stores function calls, local variables, and primitives. | Stores objects and reference types. |
| **Access Speed**  | Fast                             | Slower                              |
| **Size**          | Limited and smaller             | Larger                              |
| **Access Method** | Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)       | Random                              |

#### **Example: Stack and Heap in JavaScript**

```javascript
// Stack memory
let x = 10;         // Primitive type stored in the stack
let y = 20;         // Another primitive in the stack

// Heap memory
let obj = {         // Reference type stored in the heap
  a: 10,
  b: 20,
};

let objRef = obj;   // New reference to the same object in the heap
```

---

#### **Visualization:**

1. **Stack**:
   - Stores `x` and `y` (10 and 20).
   - Keeps track of function calls and local variables.
2. **Heap**:
   - Stores the object `{ a: 10, b: 20 }`.
   - `obj` and `objRef` both point to the same memory location in the heap.

---

#### **Exercise for Step 1:**
Write a program that:
1. Defines a few primitive variables (e.g., numbers, strings).
2. Creates an object or array.
3. Reassigns some variables and observes how references change.
